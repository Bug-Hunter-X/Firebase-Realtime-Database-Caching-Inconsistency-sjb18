This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Firebase's Realtime Database: data inconsistency due to client-side caching. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows how stale data can cause problems in a simple chat application.  The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file offers a solution utilizing the `onDisconnect()` and appropriate data synchronization methods to address the problem.  This bug is particularly relevant for real-time applications requiring high data consistency.
